# UV AquaPack – Portable Water Filtration Backpack

## Overview
The **UV AquaPack** is a portable water purification system designed as part of **ENGE 1216 (Spring 2024)**.  
Our goal was to address the global clean water crisis by creating a lightweight, reliable, and user-friendly device that combines **activated carbon filtration** with **UV light purification** in a backpack form.

This project aligns with **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**, aiming to provide safe drinking water for people in underdeveloped areas, disaster situations, and outdoor environments.

## Features
- **Activated Carbon Filter** – Removes chlorine, odor, chemicals, and contaminants.  
- **UV Light Filtration** – 21 UV LEDs line the tube, eliminating 99% of bacteria and fungi.  
- **Touch Sensor Activation** – Users activate UV lights by touch for efficient filtration.  
- **Portable Backpack Design** – Lightweight CamelBak system (~4 lbs) stores up to 2 liters of water.  
- **Fast Filtration** – Cleans water in under 5 seconds.  

## Project Goals
- Provide **clean drinking water** in areas lacking reliable access.  
- Ensure the design is **affordable** (under $50) and **sustainable**.  
- Make the system **lightweight and portable** for everyday and emergency use.
